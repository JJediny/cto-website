Use Cases can be effective when others (outside of the Product Owner) are performing user acceptance testing for an effort. While Scrum has no formal rule against their usage, it is common that most use cases eventually evolve into user stories. However, when written appropriately, they can provide the tester direction in an unfamiliar system without leading.
