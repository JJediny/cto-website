# Requesting New Software at GSA

## Introduction

Welcome to ‘Requesting New Technology at GSA!!  The Solutions Strategy IT Standards team has created this site to assist you in requesting ‘new’ technology.

New technology is defined as a tool that is not currently approved for use within GSA. Every day you face new challenges in your job, and you may find that you need a tool in order to perform your job.

We are here to assist you!!  This site contains guides and training documents on how to request a ‘new’ technology for use at GSA.

If you have any questions please call Cindy A. Smith on (816) 823-5291 or email at cindya.smith@gsa.gov.


## Research
Where do I start?  Start by discussing your need for a new technology with your colleagues and supervisor, gather information from them to determine if they can suggest what tool may be best, based upon your need.


Review the IT Standards list contained in [GSA EA Analytics & Reporting (GEAR)](https://ea.gsa.gov/#!/).  This list displays the tools that have been requested and if they have been approved or denied for use at GSA.   

Search for your tool and when the results are displayed, review the ‘Status’ to determine your next step.

If the results display:

**Approved**: The tool you require has been approved for use, and you will need to submit a request in [ServiceNow](https://gsa.service-now.com/GSA_Self-Service/software.do) to get the tool loaded onto your machine.  You do not need to submit a request using the new intake form.

**Proposed**: This tool has been submitted by another employee and is currently going through the approval process.  Once all reviews have been completed the status in GEAR will be updated.

**Denied**: This tool is not allowed for use within GSA.

**Sunsetting**: This tool has reached end of life and will be updated to reflect a status of Denied.




## Gather
To properly assess your request for a new technology we need information: cost of the technology, purpose of the technology, and a download link.  The IT Standards team has created a [Software Request Checklist](https://docs.google.com/a/gsa.gov/spreadsheets/d/1zIyZGdmEuWUeuko7yEaupETz2YGJQpOumHwiUntul64/edit?usp=sharing) to assist you.

## Request New Technology
Now that you have talked to your colleagues, your supervisor, reviewed the GSA IT Standards list, and reviewed the software request checklist you are ready to submit your Non-Standard Technology request.

If the technology you need is ‘new’ (not contained in the GSA IT Standards list), you will submit your request by clicking on the link below.

## Request Approved 

If the technology you require is an ‘Approved’ technology you will need to submit a request to [ServiceNow](https://gsa.service-now.com/GSA_Self-Service/software.do).  

#### Pilot Software Requests
If you want to try out a software tool but aren't sure if you want it to go through a full review yet, you may request to evaluate the software on a trial basis. This type of request is know as a Pilot. Pilot requests can be much faster to process, but there are several requirements it must meet in order to be considered for evaluation.
<ul><li>Pilot software must never be on a production network or contain sensitive federal data</li><li>The cost for a Pilot may not exceed $25k</li></ul>
Pilot requests require a Security review and will need to be approved by the TSC. If approved, GEAR will be updated to include the software information along with a status of Pilot. Approval for all Pilot software expires after 90 days.
At the conclusion of the pilot, the requestor will need to provide to the CTO the following key outcomes:
* Determination of whether or not the requester believes that the piloted technology is acceptable and should be a candidate for full approval
* Path to attain full security, and Section 508 approval
* Evidence that all costs have been identified and budgeted within the requesting office and as required by other affected offices, to include out-year operations and maintenance

### Monitor
After your software request is entered in ServiceNow, you will receive an email confirmation. Be sure to read that email since it will provide your service ticket number.  Any follow-up communication will also be sent to you in email from the IT Standards Desk. Be aware that follow-up communications from the IT Standards team may be a request for missing information and should be answered promptly to keep your request moving along. You can review your request information in ServiceNow by viewing your open tickets. For any questions, contact the IT Standards Team at [it-standards@gsa.gov](mailto:it-standards@gsa.gov).

### Approve
It can typically take up to 2 weeks for a request to be completed for Standard software. After your software request is approved, the ticket is marked as closed and you'll be contacted via phone or email by your local IT Service Desk. Remember, you can always check your ticket status in [ServiceNow](https://gsa.service-now.com/GSA_Self-Service/home.do).

### Acquire
Once the software is approved, you will work with your local Contract Officer (CO) to purchase a software license. Reach out to your supervisor to identify the correct CO.

### Use
If you requested web-based software, you may go ahead and start using it.
All other types of software will be installed by your local IT Service Desk within 1-2 business days of your request being approved. Contact the IT Service Desk at 1-866-450-5250 or [itservicedesk@gsa.gov](mailto:itservicedesk@gsa.gov) for questions.

### Discontinue
All software is assigned an expiration date. This date is when the software will be re-evaluated for GSA use. If software is discontinued, you will be notified via email.
When you no longer need the software, please enter a ticket in ServiceNow to have it removed from your equipment.

      What is the difference between Standard and Non-standard software?
    </button>
    <div id="Question-1" class="usa-accordion-content">
      <p>
      Standard software has previously been evaluated and approved to be included in the IT Standards List in GEAR. You must still put in a request for Standard software in ServiceNow. This type of request typically takes 1-2 weeks to complete.

      Non-standard software has not been reviewed and must be fully evaluated for Security, 508 Accessibility, and Enterprise Architecture requirements. This review and evaluation process can take 4-6 weeks to complete.

      Do I still need to enter a ServiceNow ticket if the software I want is already approved in the IT Standards List?
    </button>
    <div id="Question-2" class="usa-accordion-content">
      <p>
      Yes, you will still need to enter a ServiceNow ticket to request approved software. This initiates the process to have the Help Desk team install the software for you.

    </button>
    <div id="Question-3" class="usa-accordion-content">
      <p>
      This depends on if the software has previously been reviewed and what status it has in GEAR. If the software has a status of Approved in GEAR it will typically take 1-2 weeks to complete. If the software has not been approved it can take much longer to evaluate, up to 4-6 weeks.

      Why do I have to provide so much information for my request and how can I find it?
    </button>
    <div id="Question-4" class="usa-accordion-content">
      <p>
      This information is required for a ‘new’ software request to ensure that the tool adheres to established GSA standards.  The product must be reviewed for any Security vulnerabilities, and to determine if it is 508 (accessibility) compliant.  The 508 VPAT document must be requested from the vendor. You can go to the vendor’s website and look for it, or you can look for a phone number and contact them directly.
